Binary number
A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, 
it is a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one).
We say that a certain bit is set, if it is one, and cleared if it is zero.

For instance the binary number  
1101 represents the number  
13: 1101=1*2^3+1*2^2+0*2^1+1*2^0=13 in decimal.

Bit operators
All those introduced operators are instant (same speed as an addition) on a CPU for fixed-length integers.
Bitwise operators
&  : The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand. 
If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

|  : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit
of its second operand. If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1.
Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

 
^  : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its 
first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand. 
If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

 
~  : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, 
if a bit is set the operator will clear it, 
if it is cleared the operator sets it.
